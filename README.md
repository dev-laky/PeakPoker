# Peak Poker - Up to Everest!

This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented
programming with Kotlin at HWR Berlin (summer term 2025).

> :warning: This code is for educational purposes only. Do not rely on it!

## Development Prerequisites

Installed:

1. IDE of your choice (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA)
2. JDK of choice (JDK 21 GraalVM recommended)
3. Maven (e.g. through IntelliJ IDEA)
4. Git

## Local Development

This project uses [Apache Maven][maven] as build tool.

To build from your shell (without an additional local installation of Maven), ensure that `./mvnw`
is executable:

```
chmod +x ./mvnw
```

I recommend not diving into details about Maven at the beginning.
Instead, you can use [just][just] to build the project.
It reads the repositories `justfile` which maps simplified commands to corresponding sensible Maven
calls.

With _just_ installed, you can simply run this command to perform a build of this project and run
all of its tests:

```
just build
```

### Formatting

The repository contains an IntelliJ IDEA formatter configuration file.
It is located in the `.intellij` folder (not in `.idea`, which is the folder created by IntelliJ IDEA).
To use the formatter, you need to import the configuration into your IntelliJ IDEA settings.

Under **Settings**, go to **Editor**, then **Code Style**, click the **Gear Symbol** next to the Dropdown, click **Import Scheme**, then **IntelliJ IDEA code style XML**. Finally, select the `.intellij/formatter.xml` file.

Make sure to always use the imported `HWR OOP` code style when formatting your code.
Be aware that it might differ from the code style configured in your *Project*, or IntelliJ's *Default* code style.

## Abstract

|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | clikt                    | Command Line Interface for Kotlin | Clikt is necessary for this project because it provides a simple and intuitive way to create command-line interfaces in Kotlin. This is especially important for team collaboration as it ensures that all team members can easily understand and modify the command-line interface code. Additionally, Clikt helps in maintaining consistency and reducing boilerplate code, which improves the overall development efficiency and code quality. Lastly it provides command documentation by default. |
| 2      | kotlinx.serialization    | Kotlin Serialization Library      | This library is used to serialize and deserialize game data such as player states, hands, and game progress. It helps in saving and loading game states efficiently, which is crucial for game persistence and debugging. Serialization also facilitates potential features like network communication or saving game logs.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3      | mockito / mockito-kotlin | Mocking Framework for Kotlin/Java | Mockito and its Kotlin extensions are essential for writing unit tests by allowing mocking of classes and interfaces. This helps in isolating components during testing, ensuring the poker game logic behaves correctly under various scenarios without relying on actual implementations of dependencies. It improves test reliability and helps the team maintain high code quality.                                                                                                                |
